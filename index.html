                Highly inspired by Library Of Juggling, our goal is to organize and explain a variety of juggling
                tricks.
                <br>
                We hope to make juggling less intimidating for everyone :)

                We have created a system allowing us to animate every trick in real time with control of speed.
                <br>
                For every trick we provide an animation and basics of the trick, as well as some other sources like LoJ.

                If you are completely new to juggling - we're glad to see you here.
                <br>
                We recommend starting with <a class="trick-link" href="#">Three Ball Cascade</a> as it is the most basic
                trick.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are more advanced than that you can view <a href="#">tricks by difficulty</a> or <a href="#">Tree
                    of Tricks</a>.
